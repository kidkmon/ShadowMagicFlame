---

## üìã Overview  
| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1 - Ace of Shadows** | Animated card stack system with dynamic counters and visual feedback. |
| **2 - Magic Words**    | Dialogue system with emoji support via API, dynamic loading, and custom formatting. |
| **3 - Phoenix Flame**  | Fire particle effect with toggle control and continuous color transition. |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Architectures and Patterns  
### **Singleton**  
- Used to persist global components:
  - `LoadSceneManager`: Responsible for scene transitions.
  - `FPSCounter`: Tracks and displays real-time FPS.

### **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**  
- **Model**: Data classes such as `DialogueData` and `AvatarData`.  
- **View**: UI elements and animations (e.g., `CardCounterUI`).  
- **Controller**: Business logic (e.g., `MessageManager`).  

---

## üöÄ How to Local Run  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open the project in **Unity 6.0+**.  
3. Navigate to `Scenes/MainMenuScene.unity`.  
4. Press **Play** in the Editor.

## üêû Known Issues

- **Card stacking Z-order (Ace of Shadows)**  
  Occasionally, during fast transitions, the visual stacking of cards may briefly appear out of order due to transform hierarchy timing. Functionality is not affected.

- **Limited emoji set (Magic Words)**  
  Only a basic emoji set is currently supported via token parsing (`{emoji}`). Fallbacks for unknown tokens may not fully align with the intended emotion.

- **Clicking the screen does not complete the current dialogue (Magic Words)**  

- **Gradient flickering (Phoenix Flame)**  
  At very low frame rates, the fire‚Äôs gradient color transition may appear slightly jumpy. Smoothness depends on consistent update rates.

## üöÄ Future Work

### **Magic Words**
- **Typewriter animation for dialogue**  
  Gradual text reveal with optional user skip to enhance immersion.
- **Emoji sprite atlas support**  
  Replace `{emoji}` tokens with sprite-based images to achieve full-color emoji rendering using TMP sprite assets.
- **Dialogue skipping and rewind**  
  Allow users to skip all messages or revisit previous ones during the dialogue sequence.

### **General**
- **Visual feedback on button states**  
  Add animations or hover effects to improve UI clarity and responsiveness.
- **Audio feedback and ambient sounds**  
  Integrate SFX (e.g., fire crackle, UI clicks) to enhance the player experience.
